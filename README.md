  - [x] Dynamically render playlists on the homepage using JavaScript.
    - [x] Playlists should be shown in grid view.
    - [x] Playlist images should be reasonably sized (at least 6 playlists on your laptop when full screen; large enough that the playlist components detailed in the next feature are legible).
  - [x] Fetch data from a provided JavaScript file and use it to create interactive playlist tiles.

    - [x] Cover image
    - [x] Name
    - [x] Author
    - [x] Like count

- [x] **Playlist Details**
  - [x] Create a modal pop-up view that displays detailed information about a playlist when a user clicks on a playlist tile.

    - [x] Author
    - [x] List of songs, including each song's:

    - [x] Appear floating on the screen.
    - [x] The backdrop should appear darker or in a different shade.

- [x] **Like Playlists**
  - [x] Implement functionality to allow users to like playlists by clicking a heart icon on each playlist tile.
  - [x] When the heart icon is clicked:
    - [x] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [x] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself shuffling the same playlist more than once.
- [x] **Featured Page**
  - [x] Application includes a dedicated page that randomly selects and displays a playlist, showing the playlist’s:
    - [x] Playlist Image
    - [x] Playlist Name
    - [x] List of songs, including each song's:
      - [x] Title
      - [x] Artist
      - [x] Duration
  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once.
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

- [x] **Planning Documentation**
  - [x] Repository includes a `planning.md` file with:
    - [x] A **Data Shape** section (fields and types for playlist and song objects)
    - [x] A **UI and Interaction Rules** section (at least three rules describing what happens in the UI for a user action)
    - [x] At least one **Function Spec** (name, purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects)
    - [x] A **Featured Page** section describing the random playlist display behavior
    - [x] A **Decisions Log** with entries from at least two different milestones

- [x] **AI-Powered Playlist Description**
  - [x] The playlist detail modal includes a "Get Description" button.
  - [x] Clicking the button calls an AI API and displays a generated description within the modal.
  - [x] `planning.md` includes an **AI Feature Spec** documenting role, task, inputs, output format, constraints, and failure behavior.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** For ease of grading, open your browser's DevTools Network tab, click the "Get Description" button, and show the outbound request going directly to an AI API URL (e.g., `openrouter.ai`).

      - [ ] If users can delete a playlist, deleted playlists should no longer be included in search results.
      - **Note:** You will not be graded on the implementation of this optional subfeature to keep your grade of this stretch feature independent of your implementation of other stretch features.

  - [x] Selecting a sort option should result in a reordering based on the selected sort while maintaining a grid view.

### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Paste the **shareable link** to your animated app walkthrough below (replace `ADD_LOOM_LINK_HERE`). GitHub markdown won't render an embedded Loom player, so a plain link is what graders will use. Make sure the link is public and playable before submitting. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website. (🚫 Remove this paragraph after adding your walkthrough link.)

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics over the async and await with the usage of the fetch function in the javascript helped me to understand what is happening under the hood when it comes to API calls. Reading the documentation for OpenRouter and learning to use AI APIs with a current in demand API in AI projects was especially helpful. It was challenging to debug but with the code walkthroughs and the labs help me better understand how to debug most of the errors I ran into.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would've added a separate window or modal for deleting/creating/editing playlists. This was a time commitment I felt wasn't justified to not only do the other stretch goals but also make it seem seamless inside my UI design for this project. Another feature I consider adding was the ability to actually play music but there was an issue with having to work with an additional API (Spotify) or downloading the sound files locally.

## TODO:

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
